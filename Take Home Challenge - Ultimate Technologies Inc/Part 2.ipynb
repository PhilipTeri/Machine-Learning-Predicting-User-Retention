    "The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on\n",
    "weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active\n",
    "during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities.\n",
    "However, a toll bridge, with a two­way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend\n",
    "to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have\n",

    "#### Question 1 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this experiment is to encourage drivers from each city to work in both cities. The reason for this is because each city has a different time of day where people are most active. This means that there is a surge multiplier to the price during those times because there is high demand for drivers. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key measure of success would be a decrease in the average surge applied to each users trip. This would mean drivers from one city during their slow period(non-surge) have gone into the other city and during their peak times. Surge prices are calculated based on demand for drivers, so the hypothesis is that this should drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "I would use a two sample t-test to see if there is a significant difference in the mean of the current average surge multiplier and the average after removing tolls from the bridge. The Null hypothesis is that there will be no significant change in the aeverage of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test would give a t-value that represents the probability of getting a value above or below the mean of the t-distribution. I can then calculate the p-value of the tails of the t-distibution to determine whether the null should be rejected or not. If I set my significance level to 0.05 and the p-value is less than the significance level I can reject the null hypothesis. This would suggest that there is a significant difference the the two averages in surge prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A caveat to study is that drivers may not want to drive to another city, or may not want other drivers coming to their city, especially since this may reduce profits. \n",
